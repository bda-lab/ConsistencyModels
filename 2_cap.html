          Brewer's Conjecture and the Feasibility of Consistent, Available,

      <p>
      In this lecture, we'll define linearizability: a formal consistency model
      that's often used synonymously with strong consistency. We'll then
      present and prove the infamous CAP theorem which tells us that
      partition-tolerant distributed systems have to choose between strong
      consistency and availability. In other words, we can't have our strongly
      consistent cake and eat it with high availability too.

      In the last lecture, we established (rather informally) that a
      distributed storage system is strongly consistent if it behaves
      indistinguishably from a storage system running on a single computer. In
      this section, we'll fortify our understanding of strong consistency by
      taking a look at linearizability: a formalism of strong consistency
      initially proposed by <a
      href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7860241540823320465">
      Maurice Herlihy and Jeannette Wing in 1990</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      In the last lecture, the only storage system we looked at was a key-value
      store. In this lecture, we'll consider an even simpler storage system: a
      <strong>register</strong>. A register stores a single value.  Clients can
      issue
      <ul>
        <li>
          a <code>w(x)</code> request to write <code>x</code> to the value or
        </li>
        <li>
          a <code>r()</code> request to read the value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      An example interaction between a client (<code>a</code>) and a register
      (<code>s</code>) running on a single computer is given below. The client
      first writes the value 7 into the register and then reads it out.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 102" id="simple_reg"></svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      From now on, let's assume that the register running on a single computer
      can instantaneously process a request and send a response the exact
      moment the request arrives. With that assumption, let's take a look at
      how two clients (<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>) might interact with
      such a register when the network starts to delay and quicken the delivery
      of messages.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 152" id="async_network"></svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      The execution begins as client <code>a</code> sends a very slow
      <code>w(9)</code> request to the register. Before the <code>w(9)</code>
      request has a chance to make it to the register, client <code>b</code>
      sends a very speedy <code>w(4)</code> request. The <code>w(4)</code>
      request arrives at the register and the response arrives back at client
      <code>b</code> before client <code>a</code>'s request even has a chance
      to reach the register. Finally, client <code>a</code>'s write request
      arrives at the register, writes a value of <code>9</code>, and returns
      back to client </code>a</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      To make things clearer, we've drawn the contents of the register at the
      moment each request arrives at the register and takes effect. When the
      <code>w(4)</code> request takes effect, the register has value
      <code>4</code>; when the <code>w(9)</code> request takes effect, the
      register has value <code>9</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note that from our god's eye view, we know exactly when each request
      arrives at the register. Unfortunately, clients don't enjoy such a
      luxury. A client only knows when it sends its request and when it
      receives the corresponding response. It doesn't know exactly when the
      request arrives at the register.
      </p>

      <p>
      Let's take a closer look at an execution from the perspective of the
      clients and note something rather profound. We may not know when requests
      arrive at the register, but <em>we can guess</em>! That is, for each
      request, we can guess a time&mdash;between when the request is sent and a
      response is received&mdash;that the request <em>could have</em> arrived
      at the register.
      </p>

      <p>
      Play around with the following interactive visualization of an execution
      in which client <code>a</code> sends a <code>w(3)</code> request and then
      client <code>b</code> sends a <code>r()</code> request. You can click
      (and drag) on the thick colored bars to place your guess as to when each
      request arrived at the server.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 112" id="first_guess"></svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      In the previous execution, all of our guesses <em>could have been
      correct</em>. However, this is not always the case. Consider the
      following execution in which client <code>a</code> and client
      <code>b</code> concurrently issue write requests before client
      <code>a</code> issues a read request. Note that some of your guesses
      <em>cannot possibly be correct</em>.  More specifically, any guess in
      guess in which client <code>a</code>'s write follows client
      <code>b</code>'s write cannot possibly be correct because client
      <code>a</code> later reads <code>8</code>.
