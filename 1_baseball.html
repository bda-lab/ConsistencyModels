          Replicated Data Consistency Explained Through Baseball

      <p>
      In this lecture, we'll see why storage systems replicate their data and
      how unfettered replication can lead to anomalies. We'll then discuss how
      strong and weak consistency can help tame anomalous behavior before
      concluding with a review of the 2013 CACM article <em>Replicated Data
      Consistency Explained Through Baseball</em>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="replication">Replication</h2>
      <p>
      Often, distributed storage systems&mdash;like file systems, relational
      databases, or key-value stores&mdash;store a copy of the same data on
      multiple computers. This is known as <strong>replication</strong>. To
      motivate why storage systems replicate their data, we'll look at an
      example.
      </p>

      <p>
      Consider a non-distributed key-value store running on a single
      computer. The key-value store is nothing more than a map (or dictionary)
      from string-valued keys to string-valued values. The key-value store
      supports a dirt simple interface. Clients can issue
      <ul>
        <li>
          a <code>get(k)</code> request to retrieve the value associated with
          key <code>k</code> or
        </li>
        <li>
          a <code>set(k, v)</code> request to associate the value
          <code>v</code> with key <code>k</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      An example interaction between a client (<code>a</code>) and the
      key-value store (<code>s</code>) is animated below. The client first
      sends a <code>set(x,42)</code> request and then a <code>get(x)</code>
      request to the server. The top half of the animation shows how messages
      flow between the client and the server while the bottom half traces a
      timeline of every request and response.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 105" id="one_client_one_kvs">
        </svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      Even though there's only one key-value store, there can be multiple
      clients. Below, we animate an interaction where client <code>a</code> and
      client <code>b</code> concurrently set and then get a value from the
      key-value store <code>s</code>.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 155" id="two_clients_one_kvs">
        </svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      Unfortunately, computers don't live forever. Eventually, they crash. In
      our example, the entire key-value store is stored on <code>s</code>. This
      means that if <code>s</code> were to fail, we would irrevocably lose all
      of our data. That's no good! In reality, storage systems&mdash;like our
      key-value store&mdash;replicate data across multiple computers so that
      their data survives even when any single computer fails.
      </p>

      <h2 id="strong_and_weak_consistency">Strong and Weak Consistency</h2>
      <p>
      Replication allows a distributed storage system to tolerate computer
      failures. Unfortunately, a naively replicated storage system can behave
      very weirdly. For example, consider a key-value store replicated across
      two servers (<code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>). If a client
      (<code>a</code>) issues a <code>set(x,42)</code> request to
      <code>s1</code> and then a <code>get(x)</code> request to
      <code>s2</code>, the <code>get</code> could return something that's not
      42! This is animated below.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 182" id="anomaly1">
        </svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      This behavior is bananas! If a client issues a <code>set(x, 42)</code>
      request followed by a <code>get(x)</code> request, we expect the
      key-value store to return 42. When a storage system exposes an unbridled
      number of anomalies like this and acts completely bananas, we colloquially
      say it is <strong>inconsistent</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Ideally, a storage system can hide the fact that it's replicated from
      clients and act indistinguishably from a storage system running on a
      single computer. The replication would increase the system's
      fault-tolerance but would not cause it to expose any anomalous behavior
      to clients. For example, a <code>get(x)</code> request following a
      <code>set(x,42)</code> request would always return 42. When a replicated
      storage system behaves indistinguishably from a storage system running on
      a single computer, we say it is <strong>strongly consistent</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Reconsider the execution above where client <code>a</code> sends a
      <code>set(x,42)</code> command to server <code>s1</code> and then a
      <code>get(x)</code> command to server <code>s2</code>. If <code>s1</code>
      propagates the effects of the <code>set(x,42)</code> command to
      <code>s2</code> before responding to <code>a</code>, then <code>s2</code>
      will correctly return 42 when it receives a <code>get(x)</code> request.
      By doing this, the system implements strongly consistency. This is
      animated below.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 182" id="example_strong_consistency">
        </svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      Note that the term "strongly consistent" is not well-defined. It means
      different things in different contexts. In some contexts, it might be
      used colloquially to express a general notion that a storage system
      doesn't act bananas. In other contexts, it might be used as a synonym for
      a very formally defined form of consistency like
      <strong>linearizability</strong> (which we'll define in the next
      lecture).
      </p>

      <p>
      Unfortunately, implementing strong consistency&mdash;that is,
      implementing a system that is strongly consistent&mdash;is both
      challenging and costly. The algorithms used to implement strong
      consistency are often complex and nuanced. Worse yet, strong consistency
      is fundamentally at odds with low-latency and availability. We'll defer
      an in-depth discussion of this fact to the next lecture, but we already
      saw hints of it in the previous animation. When we made our key-value
      store strongly consistent, the <code>set(x, 42)</code> request took
      longer than it did when the key-value store was inconsistent.
      </p>

      <p>
      As a consequence, systems often eschew strong consistency in favor of
      <strong>weak consistency</strong>. Weakly consistent storage systems do
      not behave indistinguishably from storage systems running on a single
      computer. While they do expose various anomalous behaviors, weakly
      consistent systems do not completely throw consistency out the window.
      Instead, they try to sit somewhere between acting completely bananas and
      acting with strong consistency. They provide some number of basic
      guarantees that are hopefully sufficient to satiate clients.
      </p>

      <p>
      For example, consider one of the weakest forms of weak consistency:
      <strong>eventual consistency</strong>. An eventually consistent system
      guarantees that if all clients stop issuing requests for a while, then
      all the system's replicas will converge to the same state.
      </p>

      <p>
      Let's again reconsider the example execution from above, except this time
      we'll look at an eventually consistent key-value store. Each server in
      the key-value store buffers write (i.e. <code>set</code>) requests and
      propagates them to the other servers every so often. As with the
      inconsistent key-value store, a <code>get(x)</code> requests following a
      <code>set(x,42)</code> request can return something other than 42. But,
      if a client waits long enough, <em>eventually</em> a <code>get(x)</code>
      request will return 42. This is animated below.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">

        </svg>
      </div>

      <h2 id="baseball_intro">Replicated Data Consistency Explained Through Baseball</h2>
      <p>
      In addition to strong consistency, there are a buffet of flavors (or
      models) of weak consistency:
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4308857796184904369">eventual consistency</a>,
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4496511741683930603">strong eventual consistency</a>,
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11945551128380183299">causal consistency</a>,
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16870210484225303236">causal+ consistency</a>,
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4316742817395056095">RedBlue consistency</a>,
      etc. Each consistency model exposes various degrees of inconsistency with
      various performance characteristics. Some simple ones can be implemented
      efficiently but are borderline bananas. Others are more complex but
      provide stronger consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
      Is the baffling number of consistency models actually useful? Are the
      weaker consistency models too weak? Are the stronger consistency models
      too strong?
      </p>

      <p>
      Doug Terry's 2013 CACM article, <em>Replicated Data Consistency Explained
        Through Baseball</em>, answers these questions using the game of
      baseball. Terry defines six consistency models and then shows how
      different clients of a baseball application can benefit from each.
      </p>

      <h2 id="consistency_models">Consistency Models</h2>
      <p>
      In this section, we define six consistency models for a replicated
      key-value store. As with our examples above, there can be multiple
      clients issuing read (i.e. <code>get</code>) and write (i.e.
      <code>set</code>) requests to the replicated key-value store
      concurrently. We'll also augment <code>get</code> requests by allowing
      them to read multiple keys at once. For example, the request <code>get(x,
      y)</code> returns values for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
      simultaneously. This is animated below.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 105" id="multi_get">
        </svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      To make life easier for ourselves, we make a couple of simplifying
      assumptions. First, we assume that when a client issues a write request,
      the effects of the write are eventually propagated to all replicas.
      Second, we assume that all write requests are executed in the same order
      at all replicas (we'll see how to implement something like this in the
      third lecture). With these assumptions in place, the six consistency
      models will differ only in how read requests behave.
      </p>

      <p>
      We briefly define each of the consistency models here. In the next
      section, we'll give an example illustrating the differences between the
      six.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
        <strong>Strong Consistency.</strong> With a strongly consistent
        key-value store, a <code>get(x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>)</code>
        request is guaranteed to return the most recently written values of
        every key from <code>x<sub>1</sub></code> to
        <code>x<sub>n</sub></code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        <strong>Eventual Consistency.</strong> With an eventually consistent
        key-value store, a <code>get(x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>)</code>
        request is guaranteed to return values
        <code>v<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>n</sub></code> where
        <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> is any previously written value of key
        <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>. With our assumption that writes are
        eventually propagated to all replicas, if clients stop issuing write
        requests for a while, reads will (typically) return the most recently
        written values.
        </li>

        <li>
        <strong>Consistent Prefix.</strong> Recall our assumption that writes
        are executed in the same order on all replicas. With a key-value store
        guaranteeing consistent prefixes, a <code>get</code> request is
        guaranteed to return values that are consistent with some prefix of
        this sequence of writes. Note that for <code>get</code> requests
        reading a single value, consistent prefix is equivalent to eventual
        consistency.
        </li>

        <li>
        <strong>Bounded Staleness.</strong> With a key-value store guaranteeing
        bounded staleness, a <code>get(x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>)</code>
        request is guaranteed to return values
        <code>v<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>n</sub></code> where
        <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> is some value that key
        <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> took on during the last <em>t</em> minutes
        for some fixed <em>t</em>.
        </li>

        <li>
        <strong>Monotonic Reads.</strong> With a key-value store guaranteeing
        monotonic reads, a client's initial read of value <code>x</code> is
        only guaranteed to return some previously written value of
        <code>x</code> (this is equivalent to eventual consistency). However,
        each subsequent read of <code>x</code> by the same client is guaranteed
        to return the same value of <code>x</code> or a more up-to-date value
        of <code>x</code> compared with the previous read of <code>x</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        <strong>Read My Writes.</strong> With a key-value store guaranteeing
        read my writes, if a client writes a value <code>v</code> to key
        <code>x</code>, then any subsequent reads of <code>x</code> by the same
        client will return <code>v</code> or a more recently written value of
        <code>x</code>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="game_of_baseball">Baseball as a Sample Application</h2>
      <p>
      The name of the game is baseball. A baseball game consists of nine
      rounds, called innings. During the first half of each inning (called the
      top of the inning), the visiting team bats until they make three outs.
      Then, during the second half of each inning (called the bottom of the
      inning), the home team bats until they make three outs. Whichever team
      scores more runs by the end of the game wins.
      </p>

      <p>
      In the rest of this lecture, we'll model a baseball game using the
      pseudocode below. The state of a baseball game is stored in a
      replicated key-value store. The visiting score is stored under the key
      <code>"visitors"</code>, and the home score is stored under the key
      <code>"home"</code>.
      </p>

      <pre><code><strong>set</strong>("visitors", 0);
<strong>set</strong>("home", 0);
for inning = 1 .. 9
  outs = 0;
  while outs &lt; 3
    visiting player bats;
    for each run scored
      score = <strong>get</strong>("visitors");
      <strong>set</strong>("visitors", score + 1);
  outs = 0;
  while outs &lt; 3
    home player bats;
    for each run scored
      score = <strong>get</strong>("home");
      <strong>set</strong>("home", score + 1);
end game;</code></pre>

      <p>
      For simplicity, we'll assume that a single client (the official
      scorekeeper) updates the score; no other clients write to the
      <code>"visitors"</code> or <code>"home"</code> key in the key-value
      store. To illustrate the differences between the six consistency models
      defined above, let's jump into an example baseball game during the middle
      of the seventh inning. At this point in the game, the following sequence
      of writes has been produced by the official scorekeeper.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>set("visitors", 0)</code></li>
        <li><code>set("home", 0)</code></li>
        <li><code>set("home", 1)</code></li>
        <li><code>set("visitors", 1)</code></li>
        <li><code>set("home", 2)</code></li>
        <li><code>set("home", 3)</code></li>
        <li><code>set("visitors", 2)</code></li>
        <li><code>set("home", 4)</code></li>
        <li><code>set("home", 5)</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      This sequence of writes corresponds to the following inning-by-inning
      line score. We see that the visiting team scored once in the third and
      fifth inning. The home team scored once in the first, third, and fourth
      inning and scored twice in the sixth inning. Thus, the visiting team is
      behind two runs to five. We abbreviate this score as 2-5, visiting team
      first.
      </p>

        With a <em>strongly consistent</em> key-value store, the only possible
        result is 2-5: the current score of the game.
        </li>

        <li>
        With an <em>eventually consistent</em> key-value store, the visiting
        score can be read as 0, 1, or 2, and the home score can be read as 0,
        1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Note that some of the scores read&mdash;like 2-0 or
        0-5&mdash;were never actually the score of the game at any point in
        time.
        </li>

        <li>
        With a key-value store guaranteeing <em>consistent prefixes</em>, the
        score that's read may not be the most up-to-date score, but it is
        guaranteed to have been the score of the game at some point in the
        past.
        </li>

        <li>
        With a key-value store guaranteeing <em>bounded staleness</em> within
        the last inning, the visiting score must be read as 2 because the
        visiting team did not score in the sixth inning. The home score can be
        read as 3, 4, or 5: the three home scores that occurred in the sixth
        inning.
        </li>

        <li>
        After reading 1-3 from a key-value store guaranteeing <em>monotonic
        reads</em>, the visiting score can be read as 1 or 2, and the home
        score can be read as 3, 4, or 5.
        </li>

        <li>
        Since there is only a single client who updates the score, <em>read my
        writes</em> is equivalent to strong consistency for the writer and
        equivalent to eventual consistency for everyone else.

      <h2 id="participants">Read Requirements for Participants</h2>
      <p>
      In this section, we'll look at six different people&mdash;a scorekeeper,
      an umpire, a radio reporter, a sportswriter, a statistician, and a stat
      watcher&mdash;and discuss the weakest consistency model each person
      requires. In doing so, we'll see why all six consistency models are
      useful.
      </p>

      <h3 id="scorekeeper">Official Scorekeeper</h3>
      <p>
      As discussed above, the official scorekeeper is responsible for updating
      the score whenever the visiting team or home team scores a run. To ensure
      that the score is always correct, the scorekeeper must read the most
      up-to-date score just before updating it. This could be accomplished with
      strong consistency, but since the scorekeeper is the only one who updates
      the score, read my writes (which in this case is equivalent to strong
      consistency) suffices.
      </p>

      <h3 id="umpire">Umpire</h3>
      <p>
      The umpire officiates the game. After the top of the ninth inning, the
      home team finishes the game at bat. If the home team has more runs than
      the visiting team at this point, then they are guaranteed to win, no
      matter how poorly they perform in the bottom of the ninth inning. In this
      event, it is the responsibility of the umpire to end the game early. This
      responsibility is codified below.
      </p>

      <pre><code>if first half of 9th inning complete then
  vScore = get("visitors");
  hScore = get("home");
  if vScore < hScore
    end game;</code></pre>

      <p>
      In order to decide whether or not to end the game, the umpire needs the
      current score of the game. Thus, the umpire requires <strong>strong
      consistency</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="radio_reporter">Radio Reporter</h3>
      <p>
      Every thirty minutes, the radio reporter announces the score of the game
      over the radio.
      </p>

      <pre><code>do {
  vScore = get("visitors");
  hScore = get("home");
  report vScore and hScore;
  sleep(30 minutes);
}</code></pre>

      <p>
      The reported score does not have to be up-to-date; listeners are
      accustomed to hearing out-of-date scores reported on the radio. However,
      as not to mislead listeners, the radio reporter should not report a score
      that never actually occurred. Thus, the radio reporter requires
      <strong>consistent prefix</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Moreover, once the radio reporter reports a score, the reporter would
      look foolish to announce a previous score. For example, it would be a
      faux pas to announce a score of 2-3 (middle of the fifth inning) and then
      announce a score of 0-1 (middle of the second inning) 30 minutes later.
      Thus, the reporter also requires either <strong>monotonic reads</strong>
      or <strong>30-minute bounded staleness</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="sportswriter">Sportswriter</h3>
      <p>
      The sportswriter is tasked with writing an article about the game after
      it finishes. A typical sportswriter executes the following pseudocode.
      </p>

      <pre><code>while not end of game {
  drink beer;
  smoke cigar;
}
go out to dinner;
vScore = get("visitors");
hScore = get("home");
write article;</code></pre>

      <p>
      The sportswriter's article must be written with the correct final score.
      While strong consistency would suffice, the sportswriter can take
      advantage of a lengthy dinner. If the sportswriter eats for an hour, then
      <strong>1-hour bounded staleness</strong> is equivalent to strong
      consistency and meets the sportswriter's needs.
      </p>

      <h3 id="statistician">Statistician</h3>
      <p>
      The statistician, say for the home team, is responsible for recording
      season-long statistics such as the total number of runs scored. The
      statistician stores this statistic in the key-value store under the
      <code>"season-runs"</code> key. A couple hours after each game, the
      statistician adds the number of runs from the game to the season-long
      aggregate.
      </p>

      <pre><code>Wait for end of game;
score = get("home");
state = get("season-runs");
set("season-runs", stat + score);</code></pre>

      <p>
      As with the sportswriter, the statistician can use <strong>bounded
      staleness</strong> to read the home score. Since the statistician is
      the only person who updates the season-long number of runs, the
      statistician can use <strong>read my writes</strong> to read the latest
      value of <code>"season-runs"</code>, similar to how to official
      scorekeeper used read my writes to read the score during the game.
      </p>

      <h3 id="stat_watcher">Stat Watcher</h3>
      <p>
      A stat watcher checks on their team's statistics once every day and
      discusses them with friends. Because the stat watcher checks the stats
      infrequently and because reading up-to-date stats is not essential,
      <strong>eventual consistency</strong> suffices for a stat watcher.
      </p>

      <pre><code>do {
  stat = get("season-runs");
  discuss stats with friends;
  sleep(1 day);
}</code></pre>
    </article>
