      In this lecture, we'll formalize eventual consistency and strong eventual
      consistency. We'll then explore a mathematical structure called a
      semilattice and see how to use semilattices to design strongly eventually
      consistent replicated data structures known as conflict-free replicated
      data types (CRDTs).

      <p>
      In the first lecture, we looked at replicated <em>key-value stores</em>.
      In the second lecture, we looked at replicated <em>registers</em>.
      Key-value stores and registers are two specific examples of data
      structures that we can replicate. In this lecture, we'll generalize
      things and look at arbitrary replicated data structures known as
      <strong>state-based objects</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
      A state-based object is an ordinary, plain Jane object&mdash;like the
      objects you've likely seen in Python or Java&mdash;with
        (1) some <strong>internal state</strong>,
        (2) a <strong>query</strong> method,
        (3) some number of <strong>update</strong> methods, and
        (4) a <strong>merge</strong> method.
      Understanding state-based objects is easiest with an example.  Here's one
      written in Python:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="python">class Average(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.sum = 0
    self.cnt = 0

  def query(self):
    if self.cnt != 0:
      return self.sum / self.cnt
    else:
      return 0

  def update(self, x):
    self.sum += x
    self.cnt += 1

  def merge(self, avg):
    self.sum += avg.sum
    self.cnt += avg.cnt</code></pre>

      <p>
      <code>Average</code> is a state-based-object representing a running
      average. It's <em>internal state</em> are the two variables
      <code>self.sum</code> and <code>self.cnt</code> representing the sum and
      count of all the values being averaged. It's <em>query</em> method
      returns the average. It's single <em>update</em> method updates the
      average with a new value <code>x</code>. It's <em>merge</em> method
      merges in a different <code>Average</code> object <code>avg</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      A <strong>replicated state-based-object</strong> is simply a
      state-based-object that is replicated across multiple computers. For
      example, if we replicate an <code>Average</code> state-based-object
      across two servers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> (as we do below),
      then both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have a copy of the
      state-based-object. Clients (e.g.  <code>c</code> and <code>d</code>
      below) send <code>query</code> and <code>update</code> requests to a
      server's copy of the state-based-object. Meanwhile, every server
      periodically sends its copy of the state-based-object to other servers to
      be merged with the <code>merge</code> method. That looks something like
      this:
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 350" id="chaotic_replication"></svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      Animated diagrams like these help us visualize how computers communicate
      in a distributed system, but they make it difficult to keep track of the
      replicated state-based-object as it is queried, updated, and merged over
      time. To more easily visualize the replicated state-based-object, we'll
      introduce a new type of diagram. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 50" id="trivial_update_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="trivial_update_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <p>
      In these diagrams, snapshots of a state-based-object are drawn from left
      to right forwards through time. Here, we consider an <code>Average</code>
      state-based-object on a single server <code>a</code>. The initial
      snapshot of the state-based-object is labelled <code>a0</code>. Server
      <code>a</code> receives an <code>update(1)</code> request from some
      client which updates the state-based-object to the next snapshot
      <code>a1</code>. Server <code>a</code> then receives an
      <code>update(3)</code> request which updates the state-based-object to
      the snapshot <code>a2</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each update request is assigned a unique identifier which is drawn below
      the request. For example, the <code>update(1)</code> request is assigned
      an identifier of <code>0</code>, and the <code>update(3)</code> request
      is assigned an identifier of <code>1</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Beneath the diagram, we draw a table with one row for each snapshot of
      the state-based-object.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        The <em>first column</em> is the internal state
        of the object. For example, <code>a0</code> has a sum of <code>0</code>
        and a count of <code>0</code> (as specified by <code>Average</code>'s
        constructor).  Similarly, <code>a1</code> has a sum of <code>1</code> and
        a count of <code>1</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <em>second column</em> is the result of calling the snapshot's
        <code>query()</code> method. For example, <code>a1.query()</code> returns
        <code>1</code> because <code>a1.sum / a1.cnt</code> is equal to
        <code>1</code>. Similarly, <code>a2.query()</code> returns <code>2</code>
        because <code>a2.sum / a2.cnt</code> is equal to <code>2</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <em>third column</em> is the <strong>causal history</strong> of the
        snapshot: the set of identifiers of every request that has contributed
        to the snapshot's internal state. For example, <code>a0</code> hasn't
        been affected by any requests, so its causal history is the empty set
        <code>{}</code>. <code>a1</code> has been affected by the
        <code>update(1)</code> request (id <code>0</code>), so
        <code>a1</code>'s causal history is the set <code>{0}</code>. Finally,
        <code>a2</code> has been affected by the <code>update(1)</code> request
        (id <code>0</code>) <em>and</em> the <code>update(3)</code> request (id
        <code>1</code>), so <code>a2</code>'s causal history is the set
        <code>{0, 1}</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Here's an example diagram which traces a state-based-object replicated on
      two servers: <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Notice how the causal
      history of <code>a1</code> is disjoint from the casual histories of
      <code>b1</code> and <code>b2</code>. The <code>update(2)</code> and
      <code>update(4)</code> requests have not contributed to the state of
      <code>a1</code>, so their identifiers do not appear in its causal
      history. Conversely, the <code>update(1)</code> request has not
      contributed to the state of either <code>b1</code> or <code>b2</code>, so
      it does not appear in either of their causal histories.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 100" id="simple_update_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="simple_update_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <p>
      We can also use these diagrams to visualize <code>merge</code> requests.
      In the diagram below, server <code>a</code> receives an
      <code>update(2)</code> request which transitions <code>a0</code> to
      <code>a1</code>. Similarly, server <code>b</code> receives an
      <code>update(4)</code> request which transitions <code>b0</code> to
      <code>b1</code>. Then, server <code>b</code> sends a copy of
      <code>b1</code> to server <code>a</code>. When server <code>a</code>
      receives the copy of <code>b1</code>, it merges <code>b1</code> into
      <code>a1</code> which creates <code>a2</code>.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 120" id="simple_merge_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="simple_merge_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>
