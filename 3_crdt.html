      <p>
      In this lecture, we'll define a particular class of replicated data
      structures known as state-based objects and formalize what it means for
      them to be eventually consistent and strongly eventually consistent.
      We'll then survey conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs): a specific
      type of state-based object that is guaranteed to achieve strong eventual
      consistency.

      <p>
      In the first lecture, we looked at replicated <em>key-value stores</em>.
      In the second lecture, we looked at replicated <em>registers</em>.
      Key-value stores and registers are two specific examples of data
      structures that we can replicate. In this section, we'll generalize
      things and look at arbitrary replicated data structures known as
      state-based objects. We'll then introduce a way to visualize the state of
      a replicated state-based object over time.
      </p>

      <p>
      A <strong>state-based object</strong> is an ordinary, plain Jane
      object&mdash;like the objects you've likely seen in Python or
      Java&mdash;with
        (1) some <strong>internal state</strong>,
        (2) a <strong>query</strong> method,
        (3) some number of <strong>update</strong> methods, and
        (4) a <strong>merge</strong> method.
      Understanding state-based objects is easiest with an example. Here's one
      written in Python:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="python">class Average(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.sum = 0
    self.cnt = 0

  def query(self):
    if self.cnt != 0:
      return self.sum / self.cnt
    else:
      return 0

  def update(self, x):
    self.sum += x
    self.cnt += 1

  def merge(self, avg):
    self.sum += avg.sum
    self.cnt += avg.cnt</code></pre>

      <p>
      <code>Average</code> is a state-based object representing a running
      average. Note the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        <code>Average</code>'s <em>internal state</em> are the two variables
        <code>self.sum</code> and <code>self.cnt</code> representing the sum
        and count of all the values being averaged.
        </li>

        <li>
        <code>Average</code>'s <em>query</em> method returns the average. Note
        that <code>Average</code>'s <code>query</code> method does not modify
        any internal state. This is true for every state-based object.
        </li>

        <li>
        <code>Average</code>'s single <em>update</em> method updates the
        average with a new value <code>x</code>. In general, a state-based
        object can have multiple update methods.
        </li>

        <li>
        <code>Average</code>'s <code>merge</code> method merges one
        <code>Average</code> instance into another.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      A <strong>replicated state-based object</strong> is simply a
      state-based object that is replicated across multiple computers. For
      example, if we replicate an <code>Average</code> state-based object
      across two servers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> (as we do below),
      then both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have a copy of the
      state-based object. Clients (e.g.  <code>c</code> and <code>d</code>
      below) send <code>query</code> and <code>update</code> requests to a
      server's copy of the state-based object. Meanwhile, every server
      periodically sends its copy of the state-based object to other servers to
      be merged with the <code>merge</code> method. That looks something like
      this:
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 350" id="chaotic_replication"></svg>
      </div>

      <p>
      Animated diagrams like these help us visualize how clients and servers
      communicate in a distributed system, but they make it difficult to keep
      track of the replicated state-based object as it is queried, updated, and
      merged over time. To more easily visualize the replicated state-based
      object, we'll introduce a new type of diagram. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 50" id="trivial_update_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="trivial_update_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <p>
      In these diagrams, snapshots of a state-based object are drawn from left
      to right forwards through time. Here, we consider an <code>Average</code>
      state-based object on a single server <code>a</code>. The initial
      snapshot of the state-based object is labelled <code>a0</code>. Server
      <code>a</code> receives an <code>update(1)</code> request from some
      client which updates the state-based object to the next snapshot
      <code>a1</code>. Server <code>a</code> then receives an
      <code>update(3)</code> request which updates the state-based object to
      the snapshot <code>a2</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each update request is assigned a unique identifier which is drawn below
      the request. For example, the <code>update(1)</code> request is assigned
      an identifier of <code>0</code>, and the <code>update(3)</code> request
      is assigned an identifier of <code>1</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Beneath the diagram, we draw a table with one row for each snapshot of
      the state-based object.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        The <em>first</em> column is the internal state of the object. For
        example, <code>a0</code> has a sum of <code>0</code> and a count of
        <code>0</code> (as specified by <code>Average</code>'s constructor).
        Similarly, <code>a1</code> has a sum of <code>1</code> and a count of
        <code>1</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <em>second</em> column is the result of calling the snapshot's
        <code>query()</code> method. For example, <code>a1.query()</code>
        returns <code>1</code> because <code>a1.sum / a1.cnt</code> is equal to
        <code>1</code>. Similarly, <code>a2.query()</code> returns
        <code>2</code> because <code>a2.sum / a2.cnt</code> is equal to
        <code>2</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
          The <em>third</em> (and most complex) column is the <strong>causal
          history</strong> of the snapshot: the set of identifiers of every
          request that has contributed to the snapshot's internal state.
          </p>

          <p>
          For example, <code>a0</code> hasn't
          been affected by any requests, so its causal history is the empty set
          <code>{}</code>. <code>a1</code> has been affected by the
          <code>update(1)</code> request (id <code>0</code>), so
          <code>a1</code>'s causal history is the set <code>{0}</code>. Finally,
          <code>a2</code> has been affected by the <code>update(1)</code> request
          (id <code>0</code>) <em>and</em> the <code>update(3)</code> request (id
          <code>1</code>), so <code>a2</code>'s causal history is the set
          <code>{0,1}</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
          In general if <code>y = x.update()</code> where the update has
          identifier <code>i</code>, then the causal history of <code>y</code>
          is the causal history of <code>x</code> unioned with the singleton
          set <code>{i}</code>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Here's an example diagram which traces a state-based object replicated on
      two servers: <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Notice how the causal
      history of <code>a1</code> is disjoint from the casual histories of
      <code>b1</code> and <code>b2</code>. The <code>update(2)</code> and
      <code>update(4)</code> requests have not contributed to the state of
      <code>a1</code>, so their identifiers do not appear in its causal
      history. Conversely, the <code>update(1)</code> request has not
      contributed to the state of either <code>b1</code> or <code>b2</code>, so
      it does not appear in either of their causal histories.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 100" id="simple_update_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="simple_update_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <p>
      We can also use these diagrams to visualize <code>merge</code> requests.

      In the diagram below, server <code>a</code> receives an
      <code>update(2)</code> request which transitions <code>a0</code> to
      <code>a1</code>. Similarly, server <code>b</code> receives an
      <code>update(4)</code> request which transitions <code>b0</code> to
      <code>b1</code>. Then, server <code>b</code> sends a copy of
      <code>b1</code> to server <code>a</code>. When server <code>a</code>
      receives the copy of <code>b1</code>, it merges <code>b1</code> into
      <code>a1</code> which creates <code>a2</code>.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 120" id="simple_merge_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="simple_merge_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <p>
      Also notice that the causal history of <code>a2</code> (i.e.
      <code>{0,1}</code>) is the union of <code>a1</code>'s causal history
      (i.e. <code>{0}</code>) and <code>b1</code>'s causal history (i.e.
      <code>{1}</code>). This makes intuitive sense because the both the
      <code>update(2)</code> request (id <code>0</code>) and the
      <code>update(4)</code> request (id <code>1</code>) contribute to the
      state of <code>a2</code>. In general, if <code>z = x.merge(y)</code>,
      the causal history of <code>z</code> is the union of the causal histories
      of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Finally, recall that a server periodically sends its replica of the
      state-based object to other servers to be merged. Thus, our diagrams will
      look something like the following, where servers continually merge with
      one another.
      </p>

        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 120" id="converge_svg"></svg>

      <h2 id="strong_eventual_consistency">(Strong) Eventual Consistency</h2>
      <p>
      Equipped with an understanding of replicated state-based objects and
      causal history, we're ready to define eventual consistency and strong
      eventual consistency! In this section, we'll also bolster our grasp on
      the two definitions by looking at four state-based
      objects&mdash;<code>Average</code>, <code>NoMergeAverage</code>,
      <code>BMergeAverage</code>, and <code>SECAverage</code>&mdash;and decide
      whether they are eventually consistent, strongly eventually consistent,
      neither, or both.
      </p>

      <p>
      We say a replicated state-based object is <strong>eventually
      consistent</strong> (EC) if whenever two replicas of the state-based
      object have the same causal history, the <em>eventually</em> (not
      necessarily immediately) converge to the same internal state.

      We say a replicated state-based object is <strong>strongly eventually
      consistent</strong> (SEC) if whenever two snapshots of the state-based
      object have the same causal history, they (immediately) have the same
      internal state.

      Note that strong eventual consistency implies eventual consistency.
      </p>

      <h3 id="average"><code>Average</code></h3>
      <p>
      The definitions of eventual consistency and strong eventual consistency
      are best understood with examples. First, let's consider the
      <code>Average</code> state-based object we defined above and ask
      ourselves whether or not it is eventually consistent or strongly
      eventually consistent. Consider the following execution (note that we've
      abbreviated <code>update</code> as <code>u</code> and <code>merge</code>
      as <code>m</code>).
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 120" id="diverge_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="diverge_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <p>
      Snapshots <code>a2</code>, <code>b2</code>, <code>a3</code>, and
      <code>b3</code> (highlighted red) all have the same causal history
      <code>{0,1}</code>. This means that <code>a</code>'s replica and
      <code>b</code>'s replica have the same causal history. However, despite
      having the same causal history, the two replicas do not converge to the
      same internal state. In fact, they don't converge at all! As
      <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> periodically send merge requests to one
      another, the internal state of their replicas continues to change.
      Neither replica converges on a single value. <strong>Thus,
      <code>Average</code> is neither eventually consistent nor strongly
      eventually consistent.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 id="no_merge_average"><code>NoMergeAverage</code></h3>
      <p>
      Next, let's look at the following <code>NoMergeAverage</code>
      state-based object which is exactly the same as <code>Average</code>
      except that its <code>merge</code> method does nothing at all.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="python">class NoMergeAverage(Average):
  # __init__, query, and merge
  # inherited from Average.

  def merge(self, avg):
    # Ignore merge requests!
    pass</code></pre>

      <p>
      Unlike <code>Average</code>, <code>NoMergeAverage</code> is convergent.
      However (like <code>Average</code>), <strong><code>NoMergeAverage</code>
      is neither eventually consistent nor strongly eventually
      consistent.</strong> To see why, let's take a look at the following
      execution:
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 120" id="no_merge_average_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="no_merge_average_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <p>
      Snapshots <code>a2</code>, <code>b2</code>, <code>a3</code>, and
      <code>b3</code> (highlighted red) all have the same causal history.
      Moreover, both <code>a</code>'s replica and <code>b</code>'s replica of
      the state-based object converge. However, <code>a</code>'s replica
      converges to an internal state <code>{sum=2,cnt=1}</code> while
      <code>b</code>'s replica converges to an internal state
      <code>{sum=4,cnt=1}</code>. Because the two replicas converge to
      <em>different</em> internal states, <code>NoMergeAverage</code> is
      neither eventually consistent nor strongly eventually consistent.
      </p>

      <h3 id="b_merge_average"><code>BMergeAverage</code></h3>
      <p>
      Next, let's look at the <code>BMergeAverage</code> state-based object
      which is exactly the same as <code>Average</code> except for the
      <code>merge</code> function. When server <code>b</code> receives a merge
      request from server <code>a</code>, it throws away its replica of the
      state-based object and overwrites it with <code>a</code>'s replica. On
      the other hand, when server <code>a</code> receives a merge request from
      server <code>b</code>, it ignores it.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="python">class BMergeAverage(Average):
  # __init__, query, and merge
  # inherited from Average.

  def merge(self, avg):
    if on_server_b():
      self.sum = avg.sum
      self.cnt = avg.cnt
    else:
      # Server a ignores
      # merge requests!</code></pre>

      <p>
      <strong><code>BMergeAverage</code> is eventually consistent, but not
      strongly eventually consistent.</strong> To see why, consider the
      following execution.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 120" id="b_merge_average_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="b_merge_average_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <p>
      Snapshots <code>b1</code>, <code>a1</code>, <code>b2</code>, and
      <code>a2</code> (highlighted red) all have the same causal history.
      Moreover, both <code>a</code>'s replica and <code>b</code>'s replica
      eventually converge to the same internal state <code>{sum=0,cnt=0}</code>.
      In fact, it's not difficult to convince yourself that this will happen in
      every possible execution involving a <code>BMergeAverage</code>
      state-based object. <code>a</code>'s replica and <code>b</code>'s replica
      will always eventually converge to the same internal state! Thus,
      <code>BMergeAverage</code> is eventually consistent.
      </p>

      <p>
      However, let's take a closer look at snapshot <code>b1</code> and
      <code>a1</code>. Both snapshots have the same causal history
      <code>{0}</code>, but the two snapshots have different internal states.
      <code>b1</code>'s internal state is <code>{sum=4,cnt=1}</code>, while
      <code>a1</code>'s internal state is <code>{sum=0,cnt=0}</code>. Thus,
      <code>BMergeAverage</code> is not strongly eventually consistent.
      </p>

      <h3 id="max_average"><code>MaxAverage</code></h3>
      <p>
      Finally, let's look at the <code>MaxAverage</code> state-based object
      which is exactly the same as <code>Average</code> except that the
      <code>merge</code> function now performs a pairwise maximum of
      <code>sum</code> and <code>cnt</code>.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="python">class MaxAverage(Average):
  # __init__, query, and merge
  # inherited from Average.

  def merge(self, avg):
    self.sum = max(self.sum, avg.sum)
    self.cnt = max(self.cnt, avg.cnt)</code></pre>

      <p>
      <strong><code>MaxAverage</code> is both eventually consistent and
      strongly eventually consistent!</strong> To see why, consider the
      following execution.
      </p>

      <div class="svgbox">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 400 120" id="max_average_svg"></svg>
      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="max_average_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <p>
      Snapshots <code>a2</code>, <code>b2</code>, <code>a3</code>, and
      <code>b3</code> (highlighted red) all have the same causal history.
      Better yet, they all have the same internal state too! This is no
      coincidence. For <em>every</em> execution involving a replicated
      <code>MaxAverage</code> state-based object, if two snapshots have the
      same causal history, they are guaranteed to have the same internal state.
      Thus, <code>MaxAverage</code> is strongly eventually consistent (and
      therefore eventually consistent too).
      </p>

      <p>
      Unfortunately, even though <code>MaxAverage</code> is strongly eventually
      consistent, its semantics are a bit weird. For example, in the execution
      above, the effects of the <code>update(2)</code> request were completely
      overwritten by the <code>update(4)</code> request!
      </p>

      <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
      <p>
      In the following table, we summarize the consistency of the four
      state-based objects we've covered. C stands for convergent, EC stands for
      eventually consistent, and SEC stands for strongly eventually consistent.

      <h2 id="crdts">CRDTs</h2>
      <p>
      The last section demonstrated that designing a strongly eventually
      consistent state-based object with intuitive semantics is challenging.
      In this section, we define a particular class of state-based objects
      known as conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) which are guaranteed
      to be strongly eventually consistent and which usually have reasonable
      semantics. We'll then present four CRDTs: GCounters, PN-Counters, G-Sets
      and 2P-Sets.
      </p>

      <p>
      A <strong>conflict-free replicated datatype</strong> (CRDT) is a
      state-based object that satisfies the following properties.  Let
      <code>merge(x, y)</code> be the value of <code>x</code> after performing
      <code>x.merge(y)</code>. Similarly, let <code>update(x, ...)</code> the
      value of <code>x</code> after performing <code>x.update(...)</code>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        The <code>merge</code> method is <strong>associative</strong>. This
        means that for any three state-based objects <code>x</code>,
        <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, <code>merge(merge(x, y), z)</code>
        is equal to <code>merge(x, merge(y, z))</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <code>merge</code> method is <strong>commutative</strong>. This
        means that for any two state-based objects, <code>x</code> and
        <code>y</code>, <code>merge(x, y)</code> is equal to <code>merge(y,
        x)</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <code>merge</code> method is <strong>idempotent</strong>. This
        means that for any state-based object <code>x</code>, <code>merge(x,
        x)</code> is equal to <code>x</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        Every update method is <strong>increasing</strong>. Let <code>x</code>
        be an arbitrary state-based object and let <code>y = update(x,
        ...)</code> be the result of applying an arbitrary update
        <code>update</code> to <code>x</code>. The <code>update</code> method
        is increasing if <code>merge(x, y)</code> is equal to <code>y</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      To make things concrete, let's look at a very simple state-based object
      and prove it is a CRDT. The following <code>IntMax</code> state-based
      object wraps a single integer <code>x</code> where <code>merge(a,
      b)</code> computes the maximum of <code>a.x</code> and <code>b.x</code>.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="python">class IntMax(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.x = 0

  def query(self):
    return self.x

  def update(self, x):
    assert x >= 0
    self.x += x

  def merge(self, other):
    self.x = max(self.x, other.x)</code></pre>

      <p>
      We can easily verify that <code>IntMax</code> is a CRDT by proving that
      (a) <code>merge</code> is <em>associative</em>, <em>commutative</em>, and
      <em>idempotent</em> and that (b) <code>update</code> is
      <em>increasing</em>. The proofs are straightforward because the
      <code>max</code> function itself is associative, commutative, and
      idempotent!  Note that we'll abuse notation a bit and say an
      <code>IntMax</code> object <code>a</code> is equal to the integer
      <code>a.x</code> it contains.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        First, we prove that <code>merge</code> is <em>associative</em>.<br/>
        <pre><code>  merge(merge(a, b), c)
= max(max(a.x, b.x), c.x)
= max(a.x, max(b.x, c.x))
= merge(a, merge(b, c))</code></pre>
        </li>

        <li>
        Next, we prove that <code>merge</code> is <em>commutative</em>.<br/>
        <pre><code>  merge(a, b)
= max(a.x, b.x)
= max(b.x, a.x)
= merge(b, a)</code></pre>
        </li>

        <li>
        Then, we prove that <code>merge</code> is <em>idempotent</em>.<br/>
        <pre><code>  merge(a, a)
= max(a.x, a.x)
= a.x
= a</code></pre>
        </li>

        <li>
        Finally, we prove that <code>update</code> is <em>increasing</em>.<br/>
        <pre><code>  merge(a, update(a, x))
= max(a.x, a.x + x)
= a.x + x
= update(a, x)</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      We'll now turn our attention to four more complex CRDTS:
        <em>G-Counters</em> (increment only counters);
        <em>PN-Counters</em> (increment/decrement counters);
        <em>G-Sets</em> (add only sets); and
        <em>2P-Sets</em> (add/remove sets).
      </p>

      <h3 id="g_counter">G-Counter</h3>
      <p>
      A <strong>G-Counter</strong> CRDT represents a replicated counter which
      can be added to but not subtracted from.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        The <em>internal state</em> of a G-Counter replicated on n machines is
        n-length array of non-negative integers.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <code>query</code> method returns the sum of every element in the
        n-length array.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <code>update(x)</code> method, when invoked on the ith server,
        increments the ith entry of the n-length array by <code>x</code>. For
        example, server 0 will increment the 0th entry of the array, server 1
        will increment the 1st entry of the array, and so on.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <code>merge</code> method performs a pairwise maximum of the two
        arrays.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      We can implement a G-Counter in Python as follows.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="python">class GCounter(object):
  def __init__(self, i, n):
    self.i = i # server id
    self.n = n # number of servers
    self.xs = [0] * n

  def query(self):
    return sum(self.xs)

  def update(self, x):
    assert x >= 0
    self.xs[self.i] += x

  def merge(self, avg):
    zipped = zip(self.xs, avg.xs)
    self.xs = [max(x, y) for (x, y) in zipped]</code></pre>

      <p>
      If a G-Counter object is replicated on n servers, then we construct an
      <code>GCounter(0, n)</code> object on server 0, a <code>GCounter(1,
      n)</code> object on server 1, and so on.

      Let's take a look at an example execution in which a G-Counter is
      replicated on two servers where server <code>a</code> is server 0 and
      server <code>b</code> is server 1.
      </p>

      </div>
      <center>
        <table id="gcounter_table" class="srtable"></table>
      </center>

      <h3 id="pn_counter">PN-Counter</h3>
      <p>
      A <strong>PN-Counter</strong> CRDT represents a replicated counter which
      can be added to <em>and</em> subtracted from.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        The <em>internal state</em> of a PN-Counter is a pair of two G-Counters
        named <code>p</code> and <code>n</code>. <code>p</code> represents the
        total value added to the PN-Counter while <code>n</code> represents the
        total value subtracted from the PN-Counter.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <code>query</code> method returns the difference <code>p.query() -
        n.query()</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <code>add(x)</code> method (the first of the two update methods)
        invokes <code>p.update(x)</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <code>sub(x)</code> method (the second of the two update methods)
        invokes <code>n.update(x)</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <code>merge</code> method performs a pairwise merge of
        <code>p</code> and <code>n</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      We can implement a PN-Counter in Python as follows.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="python">class PNCounter(object):
  def __init__(self, i, n):
    self.p = GCounter(i, n)
    self.n = GCounter(i, n)

  def query(self):
    return self.p.query() - self.n.query()

  def add(self, x):
    assert x >= 0
    self.p.update(x)

  def sub(self, x):
    assert x >= 0
    self.n.update(x)

  def merge(self, avg):
    self.p.merge(avg.p)
    self.n.merge(avg.n)</code></pre>

      <p>
      As with G-Counters, if a PN-Counter object is replicated on n servers,
      then we construct an <code>PNCounter(0, n)</code> object on server 0, a
      <code>PNCounter(1, n)</code> object on server 1, and so on. Let's take a
      look at another example execution. For brevity, we've only listed a
      subset of a PN-Counter's internal state.
