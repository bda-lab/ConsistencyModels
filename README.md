# Consistency in Distributed Systems
Systems should be correct. Systems should be fast. Unfortunately, when it comes
to distributed systems, we can't always have both. In this reading group, we'll
survey various consistency models and see why strong consistency leads to
unavailability while weak consistency leads to headaches. Then, we'll see how
to implement weak consistency with clever data structures and strong
consistency with clever algorithms. Finally, we'll conclude with some recent
research showing that for some applications, weak consistency ain't so weak
after all.

Lecture notes can be found on the [reading group website][site]. The design and
styling of the site was stolen heavily from the very slick
[redbook.io](http://redbook.io).
